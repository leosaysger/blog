People have been recommending for me to get out and mingle with the DC tech community, so I've been trying to get out at least once a week. Yesterday I went to a meetup for [CodeNewbie] DC.

[Oliver Pattison] was kind enough to guide me through the process of publishing this website using AWS. I spend a good chunk of today getting the process to work on my linux machine, but it looks like I have everything up and running. I guess the next step is to add some plug-ins, set up TLS, and come up with a better design for the home page.
