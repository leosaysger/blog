> Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.  
-Mark Twain

There's about one month until I start [VCS] full-time. I've been taking this opportunity to travel a bit before I start drinking from the firehose. It's been good to clear my mind and focus on "self improvement". Which for me means clearing away "zero" time- or time that does nothing to help me relax or learn. Taking time to go for a run would be a productive way to relax. Getting caught in a loop trying to find yet another videogame clip to satiate an ever-present need not to be bored is "zero" time. Reading a few online articles to help clear my head is good. Reading listicles and meticulously researching gadgets I would never consider buying is bad.

For the most part I find myself being most productive in the morning. Which means I can be most productive if I do the brunt of the heavy lifting after breakfast. Almost as if I can sneak in a few productive hours before my brain is awake enough to start jonesing for social media and passive entertainment.
