I was talking to my office-mate about careers and goals and we started discussing our previous jobs. My office-mate, I'll call him Jim, used to work in a chemical production plant out in Middle of Nowhere, Idaho. This was a place where ammonia spills and explosions were just part of the job desciption. Jim said that after a particularly nastly chem spill, he could see birds raining down from the sky like some apocalyptic plague. More than a few of the more experienced guys in the plant were missing fingers; sacrificed to machinery or chemical burns. Jim's parents were in a state of constant worry and pushed him to get an office job or go back to school. Jim was tired of cornfields and living in a city of 10,000 people anyway, so he decided to look for jobs in the city.
Fastforward a couple years and Jim and I are working as office-mates in the DC metro area. Sometimes we chat. We both like PC gaming. He has dental insurance and prefers cash to a 401k. I talk about how I am considering changing careers. He responds in a respectful "whatever floats your boat" manner.
Sometimes I log in to my work computer at night to check on my work emails and I see that Jim is still in the office.
