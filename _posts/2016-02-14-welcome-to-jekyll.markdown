One of the most difficult parts of learning something new is paring the wheat from the chaff.  
Luckily, I've been able to find a few good resources to sink my teeth into.
I've been learning Ruby through [The Odin Project] and Javascript through [FreeCodeCamp].
And I recently enrolled [Viking Code School], a bootcamp that focuses on fullstack dev.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
function print_hi(name){
  console.log("Hi, " + name);
}
print_hi("Tom");
//=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

GER!
