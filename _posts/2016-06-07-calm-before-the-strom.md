Only a few more weeks until I start bootcamping full time.

I've slowly been making progress through [Hartl's Rails tutorial], which has been very informative- even if it does take a couple times to let things sink in. I've also been chipping away at the [freecodecamp] front end portion and reading up on algorithms here and there. I can see why there is such a [discrepancy] between traditional cs majors and bootcampers when it comes to algorithms and data structures. 

Whether you believe that these skills are necessary part of programming or simply pretentious fluff, the truth is that many companies rely on this metric to screen potential hires. Personally, learning this stuff has been slow going. Probably due to the fact that theory is difficult to make concrete and immediately useful. Hopefully learning about algorithms will subconsciously improve my decision-making when it comes to code. Kind of like how an engineering degree is supposed to "teach you how to learn".
