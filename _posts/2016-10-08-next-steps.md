Hey it's been a little while since I've made a personal update.

It's been almost a year since I first put my hands to a keyboard and started learning how to code. I've been lucky enough to be alive at a time where re-invention isn't out of reach and there are ample resources to help you along the way. I've definitely grown as a programmer, as well as a person (awww).

In all seriousness though, it's a good feeling being able to grab the reins and steer for a change.

Speaking of change, I am now (unofficially) a professional software engineer! I'll be working with the Devops team at Capital One. The same folks who worked on [Hygieia](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia).  

In finding a job, I learned a lot about interviewing and handling negotiations. The most important things I learned can be distilled down to:

* Know your audience
* Apply everywhere and through every avenue
* The valleys will feel a lot lower than they really are
* Don't give the first number and remember that it's a employee's market (at least in tech)

Just because bootcamp is ending soon doesn't mean that I can relax just yet. Learning Devops should keep me plenty busy for a while.  
Here are a few things I want to do in the near future:

* Learn AWS, Jenkins, and Chef
* Learn to use Vim and Tmux effectively
* Finish a MOOC for once
