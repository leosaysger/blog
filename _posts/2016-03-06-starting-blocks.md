Starting in July, I'll be attending the Viking Code School full-time. I'll be transitioning to part-time at my current job and focusing more on prep work. I've already dabbled in a few programs here and there, but I think chaining together more days of coding will let me build a kind of "learning momentum".

Regardless, It's a big commitment and I plan on making the most of it.
