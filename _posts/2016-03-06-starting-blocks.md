Starting in July, I'll be attending the Viking Code School full-time. So in preparation, I'll be transitioning my current job to part-time soon. I've started working on the prep work, but I think chaining together more days of coding will let me build a kind of "learning momentum" more easily.

Regardless, It's a big commitment and I plan on making the most of it.
