def count_and_say(n)
  # n = 1 case
  str = "1";
  #loop for nth case
  (n-1).times do
    temp = ""  
    previous = nil
    count = 0
    str.chars.each do |c|
      # increase count if current char is first or equal to previous char
      if c == previous or previous.nil?
        count += 1
      else
      # if current char is different from previous, add count and num to temp
        temp += (count.to_s + previous);
        count = 1
      end

    # add last count and num to temp then set to str for the next loop
