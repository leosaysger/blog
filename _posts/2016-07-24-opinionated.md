My life has been a pretty consistent stream of code, talking about code, and looking at code related things for the past month or so. It's also been a unique opportunity to step back and start to make out the outlines of coding as a culture.

A programmer's preferred language reflects their own philosophies and priorities. Even if someone ends up learning javascript or C# simply because it's "in demand", that in itself tells you a little about what the person values.

The importance of preference also trickles down to higher level constructs, like frameworks and text editors. In this way, you can usually judge a programmer by their cover.

A lot of this can seem like irrelevant posturing, especially to someone unfamiliar or new to programming. [Vim vs Emacs]? [C vs C++]? [Spaces vs Tabs]?

But in reality, just because something "works" doesn't mean it's an optimal solution. Coders are notoriously opinionated for (usually) good reason.
In a recent [codecast], Jessica, an engineer working at Pintrest, discussed a project working with a server-client framework. The project was to change the underlying infrastructure of Pintrest to run on Angular, which involved getting the Python speaking server to play nice with an entirely new pathway. Even faced with all the difficulties of switching such a fundamental part of their service, a company as big as Pinterest decided the pros outweighed the cons. Another company ISL, recently wrote about why they were [ditching Angular] in favor of Vue. Every decision has its pros and cons. By seeing the decision making of a company, you can glean some information about what their goals are and what their culture might be like.

These types of choices can have huge implications for real world applications: A half-second performance increase here or there, an afternoon's worth of not crawling through obscure documentation, a consistent framework that lets contributors jump right in. All these things can profoundly affect what kind of product you end up producing and whether anyone will be able to (or want to) update the code base.
