## What I've done/learned in Week 1
* Thinking modularly and pseudocoding well will save your butt down the line.   
* Working with other people has provided ample motivation in the form of "man I have to catch up" or "man I don't want to disappoint my partner".
* My terminal and text-editor prowess has improved exponentially but there's still a long way to go before proficiency.
* A.I. is hard
* Buy more snacks

In the process of making CLI games, one thing I've had to think about time and time again was choosing of a proper data structure. For games like Mastermind, the board and pieces are relatively simple to map out and subsequently render (an array of arrays). For projects like Connect Four and Tetris, things get a little more interesting. In Connect Four, we decided that an array of arrays was the simplest way to proceed. In the process of determining horizontal and diagonal wins, I wondered if a piece (or square) that is 'aware' of its surroundings might be more efficient. But considering you only have to consider win conditions for the last piece that was played, this might be a little overkill. Looking ahead, this type of association might be useful in a game like Minesweeper or any game that requires semi-real-time awareness.
