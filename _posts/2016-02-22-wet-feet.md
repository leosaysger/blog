The more I learn about algorithms, the more I see why they can be so useful. But beyond the practicality of speeding up compiling time, or optimizing the [big O notation] of a function, there's a certain charm in learning about something so fundamental.

In biology you learn that, at a granular level, chemical forces are the ones pulling the strings. And then go deep enough into chemistry, and you end up in a realm indistinguishable from physics. And dive deeper and you'll eventually find yourself dealing with statistical mechanics and probability theory. Everything leads back to numbers.

The study of algorithms provides a window into how we make decisions, or better yet, provides a way to improve upon the way we make decisions.

I've started reading through [Concrete Mathematics], written by Knuth of [The Art of Computer Programming] fame. I've never really been keen on math, but the pace and material in this text is superb. The little notes in the margins add a bit of color as well.
